```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Check that all requirements are installed: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
   - Verify the VirusTotal API key is valid

2. **Frontend won't start**
   - Ensure Node.js 14+ is installed
   - Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
   - Check for port conflicts (default: 3000)

3. **VirusTotal errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check your API quota limits
   - Ensure network connectivity

4. **File upload issues**
   - Check file size (max 200MB)
   - Verify file permissions
   - Ensure uploads directory exists

### API Error Codes
